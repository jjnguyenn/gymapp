# React-Tailwind-Firebase-oauth0 based web app

This app was styled with tailwind, a popular CSS framework that makes front end development easier.

This website allows you to track your fitness with different loggers like Workouts, Personal Records, Calories, BMI, and Progress.

There is a customized Settings modal that allows you to change your page settings and preferred units as it also updates the different loggers as you're logged in.
